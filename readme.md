# ReadMe Generator

## Objective
The objective for this project was to use javascript, node.js, and the npm inquirer to produce an application that generates a readme.md document from your terminal using prompts.

## Approach
My approach was to use what I learned in class and dive into it. I was able to start the index.js file and generateMarkdown.js without any major issues. The hard part was incorporating the license additions and then adding a photo (which my tutor explained to me).

## End Result
The end result is a working and properly functioning application that can be used to generate readme files for projects. To run this application please clone this repository, you can delete the generated readme file and this one. Then run node.js and input npm install, then input node index.js to start the prompts! Please note that if you choose to include an image, you will need the image name and it must be placed in main folder. At the end, your readme.md file will be generated.

## Reflection
This was a really fun project! Of course stressful, but really cool. I plan to manipulate and use this generator going forward.

## Final Product
Please look inside folder generated-readme for the generated file.
